Description: Docker
    Docker is a process manager with superpowers.
    It encapsulates heterogeneous payloads in Standard Containers, and runs
    them on any server with strong guarantees of isolation and repeatability.
    Is is a great building block for automating distributed systems:
    large-scale web deployments, database clusters, continuous deployment
    systems, private PaaS, service-oriented architectures, etc.
