Most frequently asked questions.
---------------------------------------------

1. How much does Docker cost?

Docker is 100% free, it is open source, so you can use it without paying.

2. What open source license are you using?

We are using the Apache License Version 2.0, see it here: https://github.com/dotcloud/docker/blob/master/LICENSE

3. Does Docker run on Mac OS X or Windows?

Not at this time, Docker currently only runs on Linux, but you can use VirtualBox to run Docker in a virtual machine on your box, and get the best of both worlds. Check out the getting started guides for help on setting up your machine.

4. How do containers compare to virtual machines?

Containers are more light weight and can start in less then a second, and are great for lots of different tasks, but they aren't as full featured as virtual machines. 

5. Can I help by adding some questions and answers?

Definitely! You can fork the repo and edit the documentation sources right there.
